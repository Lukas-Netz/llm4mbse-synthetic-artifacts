Globally, if vehicle-speed less than set-point-speed, then in response acceleration equals positive-acceleration.
Globally, if vehicle-speed greater than set-point-speed, then in response deceleration equals negative-deceleration.
Globally, if vehicle-speed equals set-point-speed, then in response acceleration equals zero and deceleration equals zero.
