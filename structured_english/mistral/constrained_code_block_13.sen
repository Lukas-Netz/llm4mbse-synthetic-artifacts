After hazard-warning-light-switch equals released until not hazard-warning-light-switch equals released, it is always the case that flash-direction-indicators equals true and indicator-direction equals all and flash-mode equals synchronically.
Globally, if ignition-key equals in-ignition-lock, then in response pulse-ratio-bright-to-dark equals 1.
Globally, if not ignition-key equals in-ignition-lock, then in response pulse-ratio-bright-to-dark equals 2.
