After hazard-warning-light-switch equals released until not hazard-warning-light-switch equals released, it is always the case that blink-right-direction-indicator equals true and indicator-direction equals right and blink-mode equals synchronically.
Globally, after not equals hazard-warning-light-switch and left-side-hazard-warning-light-switch equals released and ignition-key equals in-ignition-lock and vehicle-speed greater than 20 and left-side-hazard-warning-light-switch equals on and left-side-flash-mode equals synchronically and left-side-flash-duration-seconds equals 2.5 or left-side-flash-duration-seconds equals 3.
Globally, after not equals hazard-warning-light-switch and left-side-hazard_warning_light_switch equals released and ignition-key equals not-in-ignition-lock and left-side-flash-mode equals synchronically and left-side-flash-duration-seconds equals 2.
Globally, after not equals hazard-warning-light-switch and left-side-hazard_warning_light_switch equals released and ignition-key equals not-in-ignition-lock and left-side-flash-mode equals synchronically and left-side-flash-duration-seconds equals 2 and vehicle-speed less or equal than 20.
Globally, after not equals hazard-warning-light-switch and left-side-hazard_warning_light_switch equals released and ignition-key equals not-in-ignition-lock and left-side-flash-mode equals synchronically and left-side-flash-duration-seconds equals 2 and vehicle-speed less or equal than 20 and left-side-flash-mode equals off.
