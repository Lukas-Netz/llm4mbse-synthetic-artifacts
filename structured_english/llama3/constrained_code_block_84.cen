Globally, if current-vehicle-speed equals set-point-speed, then in response acceleration equals set-acceleration and deceleration equals set-deceleration.
Globally, if current-vehicle-speed less than set-point-speed, then in response acceleration equals positive and deceleration equals zero.
Globally, if current-vehicle-speed greater than set-point-speed, then in response acceleration equals zero and deceleration equals positive.
